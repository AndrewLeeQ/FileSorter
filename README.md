# FileSorter

## What is this? ##
File Sorter is my first attempt at javafx. 

## What does it do? ##
File Sorter separates files from a directory into different categories according to their extensions. Each file from the 'Move from' directory will be moved to the 'Move to' directory and put inside a folder with the corresponding category name.

The categories are fully customizable. When specifying extensions make sure they are in the following format: ".ext1, .ext2, .ext3" (no quotes). You can remove existing categories by fully erasing their name/extension string. Adding/editing is also possible provided the extension string is valid. Uncheck a category if you do not want it to be present in sorting. 

It might get a bit slow when moving big files.

## Why? ##
I like to hoard my downloads on the desktop and don't like cleaning it up.
